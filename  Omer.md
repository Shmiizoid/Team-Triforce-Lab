 **Omer's Bio**

Hi there! My name is Omer Abdul-Hameed, and I'm a passionate software developer. With a degree in biology and a recent completion of a 500-hour coding boot camp, I bring a unique blend of expertise in both technology and the health field. What really drives me is the intersection of these two areas, specifically health tech. I love the idea of leveraging technology to improve healthcare outcomes and make a positive impact on people's lives. My attention to detail and dedication to delivering high-quality results sets me apart. If you're looking for a software developer who not only understands the technical side but also has a deep passion for health tech, then I'm the person you need.
